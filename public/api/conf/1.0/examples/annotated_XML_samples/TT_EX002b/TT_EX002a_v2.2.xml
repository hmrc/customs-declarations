			Note KEL 208: DE 7/7 Identity of means of transport at the border is currently being incorrectly mandated on B4 and C1 declarations when DE 7/4 Mode of transport at the border is coded 1(Maritime), 3(Road), 4(Air), 8(Inland Waterway) or 9(Mode Unknown). Until this is resolved, it will be necessary to complete both components of DE 7/7 in these circumstances. 
			***
			Note KEL 277: On Exports declarations, where Direct or Indirect Representation is indicated in Data Element 3/21 (values "2" or "3"), Representative details will be incorrectly required (in either DE 3/19 - Name and Address details or DE 3/20 - Representative ID), even when the Representative is the same Party as the Declarant.
			***
			
			SCENARIO
			Type C Exports standalone simplified Declaration. 
			Re-export of goods previously entered to Inward Processing (IP). 

			Type â€“ C simplified export Declaration moves to Type C - Re-Arrived simplified Export declaration. 
			Procedure code 3151, additional procedure code 1CS.
			Data set category C1. 
			This scenario covers the presentation of a simplified declaration from a Customs Supervised Exports (CSE) based trader.
			The declaration will therefore quote or need to quote an approved CSE based location.
			For the generation of movement messages the declared C declaration will equate to a Re-Arrival at the UK Frontier Port.
			
			Steps for execution:
			 - Step 1 - Declaration with 1 DUCR only.
			 - Step 2 - EAL Message with 1 DUCR only.
			 - Step 3 - EDL Message with 1 DUCR only.
			
			Expected notifications:
			 - Where declaration is accepted and validation successful - DMSACC - ( Function Code 01).
			 - Where declaration is cleared of the goods - DMSCLE - ( Function Code 09).
			 - Where declaration is finalised and the goods have exited - DMSEOG - ( Function Code 16).
			
			Note that declarations for CSE controlled goods require:
			 - DE 1/2 Additional Declaration Type to reflect the new approach of the declaration being declared as "Arrived" i.e. Types A, B or C.
			 - DE 1/11 Additional Procedure Code 1CS - this is a CDS workaround pending confirmation or a new solution to provide CSE functionality (as the Tariff currently does not include this code).
			 - DE 3/39 Holder of the Authorisation quoting the CSE authorisation.
			 - DE 5/23 Location of Goods to reflect the approved CSE inland location.
