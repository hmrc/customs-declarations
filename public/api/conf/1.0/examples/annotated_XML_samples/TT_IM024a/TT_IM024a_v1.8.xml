			SCENARIO
			GB-NI 'At Risk' and EU SIV Duties
			
			A self-representing frontier declaration: H1 additional declaration Type Y (Supplementary) declaration
			Goods being imported from GB to NI.
			Goods are deemed to be 'At Risk'.
			Goods are subject to Standard Import Value (SIV) measures.
			Valuation Method 4 without Item Price declared; Additional Procedure Code E02 declared.
			AI code 'NIDOM' entered at Item Level.
			CDS validates the declaration against EU Tariff.
			CDS calculates Customs Duties using the EU Tariff rate, based on the SIV price.
			CDS notifies the Trader via DMSTAX of the duties payable.
			Procedure code 4000 Additional Procedure code E02.
			Goods: Fresh courgettes from Great Britain, 1000kg.
			Importer is an AEO authorisation holder, DAN holder, and SDE authorised party.
			Deferment used for payment of duty & security.
			Goods presented at Warren Port, Belfast.

			Expected Notifications: DMSTAX(1), DMSACC, DMSTAX(2), DMSCLE

			N.B: Data elements 6/14 to 6/17 and 4/17 use Tariff codes for fresh fruit and vegetables. Many of these
			Tariff codes are seasonal and the associated preference/SIV/SPV measures may change or expire. The declaration
			may be rejected if a code entered is not active on the acceptance date.
