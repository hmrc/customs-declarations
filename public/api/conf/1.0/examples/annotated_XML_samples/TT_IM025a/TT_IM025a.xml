			SCENARIO
			Standard declaration: H1 additional declaration Type Y – Release for Free Circulation
			Goods being imported from RoW to NI
			Goods are deemed to be 'At Risk'
			Goods are subject to Simplified Procedure Value (SPV) measures
			Procedure code 4000 with Additional Procedure Code 000 declared
			Valuation Method 1 with Item Price declared
			AI code 'NIIMP' entered at Item Level

			CDS validates the declaration against EU Tariff
			CDS calculates Customs Duties using the EU Tariff rate, based on the SPV price
			CDS notifies the Trader via DMSTAX of the duties payable

			Importer is an AEO authorization holder, holds DAN
			Importer EORI number: XI553202734852
			No licence required for this commodity
			Self-representation used by the importer

			Commodity Code: 0805509010 (Edible fruit and nuts; peel of citrus fruit or melons)
			Country of Origin : Israel
			Valuation Method: 1 – SPV with item Price
			Net Mass: 1000kg

			N.B: Data elements 6/14 to 6/17 and 4/17 use Tariff codes for fresh fruit and vegetables. Many of these
			Tariff codes are seasonal and the associated preference/SIV/SPV measures may change or expire. The
			declaration may be rejected if a code entered is not active on the acceptance date.
			
			Expected Notifications: DMSTAX(1), DMSACC, DMSTAX(2), DMSCLE
