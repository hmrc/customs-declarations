            SCENARIO
            GB-NI 'At Risk' - CAP Safeguarding Duties.

            Trader submits a Type D (Pre-Lodged) Declaration:
            - Goods being imported from GB to NI.
            - Goods are deemed to be 'At Risk'.
            - Goods are subject to CAP Safeguarding measures.
            - The declared item price is lower than the L1 reference price and lower than the representative price as specified in the EU Tariff.
            - AI code 'NIDOM' entered at Item Level.

            CDS validates the declaration against EU Tariff.
            CDS calculates Customs Duties using the EU Tariff rate, including the additional CAP Safeguarding duties.
            CDS notifies the Trader via DMSTAX of the duties payable.
