			SCENARIO
            Removal of goods from a private customs warehouse using EIDR.
            EIDR Supplementary Declaration Type Z which derives a H1 Declaration Category data set.
            Procedure code 4071, no additional procedure 000.
            Deferred payment is being used with standing authority - Declarant is authorized to use the Importer's DAN.
            Agent has a Function Code of 2 indicating a direct representative of the importer.
            Agent and Declarant ID have the same EORI values of Declarant/ Agent EORI: GB603202734852.
            Also results in a FEC challenge, which is detailed in the DMSACC Trader Notification: “Incredible value found : Value per kilo appears too high for this commodity”.
            Acceptance Date is present on all supplementary declarations, and will match the CLE date listed in 2/1.
