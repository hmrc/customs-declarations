		<!--SCENARIO
			Imports simplified frontier (Type C) declaration.
			A Trader chooses to utilise the Duty Calculation Manual Override functionality for this type of Declaration (Type C Simplified) where the Tax Base and Tax Payable Amount values are entered.
			Procedure Code 44 21 has been used to claim duty (and where applicable VAT) relief under end use with simultaneous release for free circulation and home use, where the goods are being re-imported following temporary export under outward processing.
			Expected notifications (2): DMSACC and DMSCLE
			
			Notes:
			• This declaration uses a frontier declaration at Wallasea Island, Baltic Wharf (NILP) for test purposes only: for business use a pre-lodged declaration must be submitted because Baltic Wharf is listed as an 'Other listed location'.
			• Since the introduction of this sample, duties are no longer calculated on Type C/F declarations so the duty override claimed in the scenario is no longer required.
