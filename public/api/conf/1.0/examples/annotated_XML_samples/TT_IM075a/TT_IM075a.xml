		<!--SCENARIO
		
			A Type IMA declaration is submitted importing goods that are subject to a P&R licence measure in UK Tariff, which is eligible for a waiver by using the new Document Waiver Code 999L.

			A trader submits a Type IMA declaration importing goods from ROW to GB.
			Goods are imported and declared to free-circulation and home use of non-union goods, with no previous procedure.
			Procedure code 4000, additional procedure code 000.
			Goods: Solanum Melogena L (Aubergine Plants), Origin Netherlands.
			Frontier declaration: H1 additional declaration type A.
			Importer is not an AEO authorisation holder.
			Self-representation by the Trader.
			Deferment used for payment of duty.
			Goods presented at Baltic Wharf, Wallasea Island (NILP). 
							
			The trader declares:
			• Document Code 999L is entered in D.E. 2/3 at item level.
			• Document ID is optional and is not validated.
			• Reason Statement entered by the trader.
			
			The Document Code 999L is validated in the UK Tariff.

			The declaration will be successfully accepted and cleared.
			Tax will be calculated using UK Tariff.
			CDS will generate trader notifications. 
			
			Note that this declaration uses a frontier declaration at Wallasea Island, Baltic Wharf (NILP) for test purposes only: for business use a pre-lodged declaration must be submitted because Baltic Wharf is listed as an 'Other listed location'.
