			SCENARIO
			To show that CDS can process an import Declaration where the combined use of a procedure code and additional procedure code, result in Excise Duty Suspension.

			An agent submits an Imports Type A declaration importing goods from ROW to GB, declaring:
			• Procedure Code: 0700 in D.E. 1/10.
			• Additional Procedure Code: F06 in D.E 1/11.
			• Commodity code 2204101500 importing goods from the country Italy.
			• Goods: Proscecco Sparkling wine designation of origin (DPO). 
			• Deferred Payment is used with standing authority. 
			• Importer's DAN is being used.
			• Goods presented at Wallasea Island on arrival. 
			
			Note that this declaration uses a frontier declaration at Wallasea Island, Baltic Wharf (NILP) for test purposes only: for business use a pre-lodged declaration must be submitted because Baltic Wharf is listed as an 'Other listed location'.
			
			CDS will accept and process the declaration:
			• Customs Duty, Excise and VAT will be calculated using the UK Tariff.
			• DMS will generate trader notifications.
