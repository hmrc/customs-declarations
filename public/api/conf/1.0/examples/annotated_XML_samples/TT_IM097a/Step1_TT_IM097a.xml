			SCENARIO

			A trader submits a Type A (H1) Declaration importing goods from the Continental Shelf (CS) UK into NI.



			The trader enters the following information on the declaration:

			- Country of Dispatch 'ZU' in DE 5/14

			- Country of Origin 'ZU' in DE 5/15

			- Border Transport Means Nationality Code 'ZU' in DE 7/15

			- NI Goods Location Code is declared in DE 5/23

			- NI Trade Terms Location Code is declared in DE 4/1

			- Additional Information Code 'NIIMP' in DE 2/2

			- Additional Information Code 'NIREM' for de-risking in DE 2/2.

			

			CDS must calculate the Customs Duty, Excise and VAT payable, according to the relevant measures applicable in the UK Tariff.



			No Excise Duty will be calculated using the UK Tariff.



			Custom Duty will be calculated using the UK Tariff at a rate of 20%.



			No VAT will be calculated using the UK Tariff as a UK VAT zero rate is applied.

			

			The trader gets notifications including DMSTAX from DMS confirming the successful acceptance and clearance of the declaration.



			Duties will be collected via the method of payment declared.
