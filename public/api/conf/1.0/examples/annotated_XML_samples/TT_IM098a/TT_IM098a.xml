            SCENARIO
            An agent submits a Type A (H1) Declaration importing goods from the Continental Shelf (CS) Norway into NI.

            The agent enters the following information on the declaration:
            • Country of Dispatch 'ZN' in DE 5/14.
            • Country of Origin 'ZN' in DE 5/15.
            • Border Transport Means Nationality Code 'ZN' in DE 7/15.
            • NI Goods Location Code is declared in DE 5/23.
            • NI Trade Terms Location Code is declared in DE 4/1.
            • Additional Information Code 'NIIMP' in DE 2/2.

            CDS must calculate the Customs Duty, Excise and VAT payable, according to the relevant measures applicable in the EU Tariff.

            No Excise Duty will be calculated using the EU Tariff.

            Custom Duty will be calculated using the EU Preferential Tariff rate of 3%.

            No VAT will be calculated using the EU Tariff as a VAT zero rate is applied.

            The agent gets notifications including DMSTAX from DMS confirming the successful acceptance and clearance of the declaration.

            Duties will be collected via the method of payment declared.

            Please note that this scenario isnt performing as expected and will be updated in a future release.
