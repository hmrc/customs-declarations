			SCENARIO
			
			Energy Import via a Fixed Transport Installation on an EIDR supplementary declaration where Climate Change Levy (CCL) will be relieved

			An agent submits a Type Z (H1) EIDR supplementary declaration importing goods (i.e. electricity) from ROW to GB.

			The agent enters the following information on the declaration:
			 - Acceptance Date is present on all supplementary declarations, and will match the CLE date listed in 2/1.
			 - Agent has a Function Code of 2 indicating a direct representative of the importer.
			 - Agent and Declarant ID have the same EORI values of Declarant/ Agent EORI: GB603202734852.
			 - Procedure code 4000
			 - Additional Procedure Code '1CL' at item level in DE 1/11
			 - Mode of Transport of '7' at header level in DE 7/4
			 - Authorisation Type Code 'FTI' in DE 3/39
			 - Additional Document Code 'C676' in DE 2/3
			 - FTI Goods Location Code 'GBDUASFDOVIFA' at header level in DE 5/23
			 - National Additional Code 'X99D' in DE 6/17.
			 - A Climate Change Levy will be calculated and 100% relief applied to this import.

			No Customs Duty and VAT will be calculated using the UK Tariff.

			The agent gets notifications from DMS confirming the successful acceptance, tax calculated and clearance of the declaration.

			The DMSTAX notification will show the CCL excise charge calculated and the 100% relief applied.
