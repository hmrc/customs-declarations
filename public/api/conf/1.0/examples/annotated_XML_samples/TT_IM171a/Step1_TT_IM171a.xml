			- DE 1/11 Additional Procedure Code: 00 declared at the header level
			- DE 2/2 NIIMP and NIREM declared at item level
			- DE 2/3 Additional Document Codes: 1UKI, C505 and C506 declared at the item level.
			- DE 3/16 Importer EORI starting with XI declared at header level.
			- DE 3/18 Declarant EORI starting with XI declared at header level.
