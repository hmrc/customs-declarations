		<!--
			SCENARIO
			Goods imported and declared to Free circulation and Home Use.
			Procedure code 4000.
			Additional procedure code 000.
			Goods: High Strength beer.
			Frontier declaration: H1 additional declaration type D.
			Importer is not an AEO authorisation holder.
			Agent employed by the importer under direct representation.
			Deferment used for payment of VAT & Excise (i.e. non Customs Duties). 
			Therefore, there is no need to include the Additional Documents C505/C506, their associated Authorisation Holder references in D.E 3/39 (CGU/DPO), or the Obligation Guarantee details (D.E 8/2 & 8/3), as no Customs Duty is due.
			Goods presented at Baltic Wharf, Wallasea Island (NILP). 
			
			Note CDS has been designed to use ASV for determining the duty due. Hence the system expects the Trader to declare ASV. However, if the Trader does want to use ASVX, they would have to also declare ASV at this particular point in time. This would result in the same duty calculation. If the Trader declares ASVX on its own, this will result in a declaration rejection due to the need of ASV for compliance checks. We require a policy decision to be made on whether ASVX in the future can be used on its own.
