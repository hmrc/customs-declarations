Sample Instructions 
*******************

A CSP submits a query for an Import declaration they have submitted, using the MRN parameter.

All versions of the declaration that matches the input search parameter must be returned in a single response.

Declaration versions should be returned in reverse chronological order.

Example DIS search query: https://api.qa.tax.service.gov.uk/customs/declarations-information/mrn/21GBDVCRQ90LUHQAR7/version 

Data for this scenario will be generated by running a base payload, and then running multiple amendments to create the various version numbers.
