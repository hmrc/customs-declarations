			SCENARIO:
			Goods imported from countries with which the EU has a Customs Union into Northern Ireland.  
			In this scenario the goods are being imported in from Turkey (TR) into Northern Ireland (GB).  
			Expected Notifications (4): DMSACC, DMSTAX(1), DMSTAX(2) and DMSCLE
			
			Note KEL-239 when testing: When a trader declares ALVS documents in D/E 2/3 on an Import declaration in a goods item, they are currently required to enter a Country of Origin in D/E 5/15. 
			However, when the same declaration includes a claim for a Quota Preferential Rate, they are also required to enter a Preferential Country of Origin in D/E 5/16.
