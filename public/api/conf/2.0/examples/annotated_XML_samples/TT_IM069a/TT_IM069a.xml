			SCENARIO
			ROW-NI at Risk - Suspension Procedure.
			
			Goods are deemed ‘At Risk’. 
			
			EU Tariff is to be used to calculate the duties. 
			
			Subsidy will be used to cover the EU differential charges and displayed as a security. 
						
			A Trader submits a Type Z (H4 data set) Supplementary Declaration for goods imported from ROW into NI, declaring: 
			• Procedure code: 5100. 
			• Additional Procedure Code (APC) A04 is used to suspend EU VAT (B05) and UK VAT (B00) in full.
			• Goods: 7009910000 (Unframed glass mirrors - STK12345)
			• Importer is not an AEO authorisation holder
			• Self representation declaration
			• Goods presented at the port of Belfast
			
			Expected Notifications: DMSTAX(1), DMSACC, DMSTAX(2), DMSCLE
