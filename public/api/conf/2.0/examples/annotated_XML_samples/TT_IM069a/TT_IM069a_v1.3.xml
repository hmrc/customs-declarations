			***
			This scenario is impacted by KEL 456: For declarations which include AI codes NIIMP and NIAID, duty calculation should return a full subsidy reservation and should trigger collection of a Security for the difference in the Customs Duties between the EU (eg 4%) and UK (eg 0%). However the calculation response is not triggering security and so the A50 Customs Duty Amount is being charged outright. 
			
			Please note KEL 456 will be fixed as part of TTM19.0.1, scheduled for July 2022. Additional information can be found within the CDS_Trade_Test_KEL_20220616 (KEL) document.
			***
			
			SCENARIO
			ROW-NI at Risk - Suspension Procedure.
			
			Goods are deemed ‘At Risk’. 
			
			EU Tariff is to be used to calculate the duties. 
			
			Subsidy will be used to cover the EU differential charges and displayed as a security. 
						
			A Trader submits a Type Z (H4 data set) Supplementary Declaration for goods imported from ROW into NI, declaring: 
			• Procedure code: 5100. 
			• Additional Procedure Code (APC) A04 is used to suspend EU VAT (B05) and UK VAT (B00) in full.
			• Goods: 7009910000 (Unframed glass mirrors - STK12345)
			• Importer is not an AEO authorisation holder
			• Self representation declaration
			• Goods presented at the port of Belfast
			
			Expected Notifications: DMSTAX(1), DMSACC, DMSTAX(2), DMSCLE
