			SCENARIO
			To show that CDS does not reject the import declaration where a status code XX is entered with the document code C678.

			An agent submits a H1 standard frontier Type A Declaration importing goods from RoW-GB, declaring:
			• Procedure type: 40 00 in DE 1/10 indicating entry for free circulation and home use of goods.
			• Document Code: C678 in DE 2/3 indicates Common Health Entry Document for Feed and Food of Non-Animal Origin. 
			• Entering a Document Status Code: XX meaning the goods covered by the commodity code do not require a licence.
			• Commodity code 1905320500 importing goods from the country Jamaica.
			• Deferred Payment is used with standing authority. 
			• Importer's DAN is being used.
			• Goods presented at Wallasea Island on arrival.
			
			Note that this declaration uses a frontier declaration at Wallasea Island, Baltic Wharf (NILP) for test purposes only: for business use a pre-lodged declaration must be submitted because Baltic Wharf is listed as an 'Other listed location'.
			
			CDS will accept and process the declaration:
			• CDS must not reject the declaration as a Status code XX has been entered.
			• Customs Duty and VAT will be calculated using the UK Tariff.
			• No Excise will be calculated using the UK Tariff.
			• DMS will generate the trader notifications.
