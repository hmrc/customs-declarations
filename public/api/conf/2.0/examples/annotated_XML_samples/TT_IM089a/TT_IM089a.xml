            SCENARIO
            To show that CDS does not reject an import declaration where the validation of certain status codes has been removed when document C400 has been entered with a status code of 'JA'.

            A trader submits a SDP Type Y supplementary Declaration H1 importing goods from RoW-GB, declaring:
            • Document Code: C400 to satify the CITES measure with status code 'JA' to indicate licence/certificate attributed on SFD. D.E. 2/3.
            • Commodity Code 9601900000 importing goods from the country Kenya.

            CDS will accept and process the declaration:
            • No Customs Duty and Excise will be calculated using the UK Tariff.
            • VAT will be calculated using the UK Tariff.
            • DMS will generate the trader notifications.
