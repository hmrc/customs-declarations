			SCENARIO
			
			Lithium-ion Electric Accumulators Import which is deemed 'At Risk' of entry to the EU.
			
			An agent submits a Type A declaration importing goods ('At Risk') from RoW (USA) to NI. 
			
			The agent enters the following information on the declaration: 
			  -  Agent has a Function Code of 2 indicating a direct representative of the importer.
			  -  Procedure Code '4400'.
			  -  Additional Procedure Code '000' in DE 1/11.
			  -  Additional information codes 'NIIMP' and 'EUPRF' in DE 2/2 at item level.
			  -  EU end use preference code '115' in the free text field of 'EUPRF' in DE 2/2.
			  -  UK preference code '100' in DE 4/17.
			  -  Additional Document Code 'C506', 'C505', 'N990', 'N935' in DE 2/3.
			  -  UK Preference Code '100' in DE 4/17
			  -  Combined Procedure Code '8507600073' in DE 6/14.
			  
			Customs duty is calculated and charged according to the EU Tariff, at the prevailing EU Relief rate, due to the nature of the  Commodity and the Country of Origin. 
			
			The relief will be permitted from the normal duties applicable to imported goods that are 'At risk' of entering the EU. 
			
			No UK Customs Duty, UK Excise Duty or UK additional duties are charged. 
			
			VAT is calculated using the UK Tariff.

			Please note that this scenario isnt performing as expected and will be updated in a future release.
