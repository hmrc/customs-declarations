            SCENARIO
            To show that CDS does not reject an import declaration where the validation of certain status codes has been removed when document C400 has been entered with a status code of 'JA'.

            A trader submits a SDP Type Y supplementary Declaration H1 importing goods from RoW-GB, declaring:
            • Document Code: C400 to satify the CITES measure with status code 'JA' to indicate licence/certificate attributed on SFD. D.E. 2/3.
            • Commodity Code 9601900000 importing goods from the country Kenya.

            CDS will accept and process the declaration:
            • No Customs Duty and Excise will be calculated using the UK Tariff.
            • VAT will be calculated using the UK Tariff.
            • DMS will generate the trader notifications.

                            Note CDS has been designed to use ASV for determining the duty due. Hence the system expects the Trader to declare ASV. However, if the Trader does want to use ASVX, they would have to also declare ASV at this particular point in time. This would result in the same duty calculation.
                            If the Trader declares ASVX on its own, this will result in a declaration rejection due to the need of ASV for compliance checks.We require a policy decision to be made on whether ASVX in the future can be used on its own.  -->
