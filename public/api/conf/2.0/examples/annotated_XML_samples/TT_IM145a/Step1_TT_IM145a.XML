            SCENARIO
            A trader submits a Type A (H1) Declaration importing goods from the ROW to GB.

            The trader enters the following information on the declaration:
            â€¢ 'ECONE' in DE 2/2.
            â€¢ Supplementary Units 'LPA' in DE 6/2.
            â€¢ Commodity code of a composite good containing alcohol in DE 6/14.
            â€¢ TARIC Additional Code 'X345' in DE 6/17.
            â€¢ Tax Type '345' is declared in DE 4/3.
            â€¢ Tax Base declared in DE 4/4 for each Tax Type.

            Manually calculate and charge excise duty using the excise code X345, at the rate corresponding to the excise code on the alcoholic component of the goods item only (not the total volume) using the codes declared in DE 6/17

            Custom Duty and VAT will be manually calculated.

            The UK VAT standard rate of 20% will be applied.

            The trader gets notifications including DMSTAX from DMS confirming the successful acceptance and clearance of the declaration.

            Duties will be collected via the method of payment declared.

            Incredible value warning (DMS13000, 'value of item 1 appears too low for this commodity')

            This payload has been amended using TT_IM100a as a sample.
