		<!--SCENARIO

        This scenario is a result of a specific request for a sample using procedure code '5171'.
        TT_IM146a has been used as the basis for the scenario.

            A trader submits a Type A Frontier declaration (H4), importing packing goods from ROW to GB.

            The trader enters the following information on the declaration:
            - Procedure Code '5171' at item level in DE 1/10.
            - CWP authorisation in De 3/39, plus corresponding doc C517 in DE 2/3
            - Customs Warehouse ID in DE 2/7

            The Declaration is Accepted, Tax Calculated and Cleared.
