            SCENARIO
            A trader submits a Type A Frontier declaration (H3), importing packing goods from ROW to GB.

            The trader enters the following information on the declaration:
            - Procedure Code '5300' at item level in DE 1/10.
            - Additional Procedure Code 'D07' at item level in DE 1/11.
            - The UK tariff will be used to calculate any duties.

            The Declaration is Accepted, Tax Calculated and Cleared.

            CDS will not reserve a security but continue to apply BAU duty relief.
