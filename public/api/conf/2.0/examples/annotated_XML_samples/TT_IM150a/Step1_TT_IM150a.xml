            CDSNIP-706 - Declaration and Validation of Goods At Risk Status Codes

            RoW to NI - NIIMP [NIREM + NIHIS] (Apportionment - Goods Item Split Into 2)
            A Trader submits a Type A (H1) declaration importing goods from RoW to NI. The Trader seeks to declare goods "Not At Risk" as a proportion
            (80%) of the imported goods will remain in NI whilst the remaining proportion (20%) will NOT remain in NI. The goods item are therefore declared in 2 parts:
            Procedure code 40 00, with 000 (no additional procedure code)
            Standard declaration: H1 additional declaration type A – Release for Free Circulation.
            Importer EORI number: XI553202734852
