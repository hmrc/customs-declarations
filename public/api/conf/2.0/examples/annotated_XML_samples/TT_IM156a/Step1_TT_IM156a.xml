            SCENARIO
            CDSNIP-709 - Subsidy processing with UKIMS
            RoW to NI NIIMP "AT RISK" NIAID APPLIED - USER STORY 3 - Subsidy Claim NOT Allowed
            A Trader submits a Type A (H1) declaration importing goods from RoW to NI for which subsidy claim is NOT allowed and is NOT processed.
            The sum of duty for a goods item on a declaration has resulted in EU Tariff higher than the UK Tariff
            but is 3% or less higher (based on the difference in the duty for the 2 tariffs, expressed as a percentage of the customs value).
            Goods are being imported from ROW (India)to NI "At Risk"
            Goods: Jerseys and pullovers, containing at least 50|% by weight of wool and weighing 600|g or more per article
            Category: H1 Declaration Category data set
            Goods presented at the port of Belfast.
