            SCENARIO
            This Special Fiscal Territories scenario will ensure that the correct amount of duties is applied for imports into Mainland UK from Guernsey and Jersey.
            A trader submits a Type A (H3) declaration importing goods from ROW-GB that have entered Guersey and Jersey but not in free circulation
			Type A Imports from Special Fiscal Territories.
            Export country: Goods arriving from - but not originating from - Guernsey and Jersey (GB Only Movements)
            Declaration made by Agent using Direct Representation.
            Commodity: Electric Guitar in aluminium case.
            Goods location: Wallasea Island, Baltic Wharf
            Expected Notifications (4): DMSACC, DMSTAX(1), DMSTAX(2) and DMSCLE

            Note that this declaration uses a frontier declaration at Wallasea Island, Baltic Wharf (NILP) for test purposes only: for business use a pre-lodged declaration must be submitted because Baltic Wharf is listed as an 'Other listed location'.
