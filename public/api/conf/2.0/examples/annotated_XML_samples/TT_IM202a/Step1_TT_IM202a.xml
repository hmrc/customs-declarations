            SCENARIO
            GB-NI 'At Risk' - CERTEX: Check Availability with/without Quantity Reservation

            Trader submits a Type D (Pre-Lodged) Declaration:
            - Goods being imported from GB to NI.
            - Goods are deemed to be 'At Risk'.
            - Goods are subject to CERTEX check.
            - Procedure code: 4400.
            - AI code 'NIIMP' entered at Item Level.

            CDS validates the declaration against EU Tariff.
            CDS calculates Customs Duties using the EU Tariff rate,
            CDS notifies the Trader via DMSTAX of the duties payable.
