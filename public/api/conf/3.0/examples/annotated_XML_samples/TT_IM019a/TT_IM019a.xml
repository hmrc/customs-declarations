            Note CDS has been designed to use ASV for determining the duty due. Hence the system expects the Trader to declare ASV. However, if the Trader does want to use ASVX, they would have to also declare ASV at this particular point in time. This would result in the same duty calculation. If the Trader declares ASVX on its own, this will result in a declaration rejection due to the need of ASV for compliance checks. We require a policy decision to be made on whether ASVX in the future can be used on its own.
