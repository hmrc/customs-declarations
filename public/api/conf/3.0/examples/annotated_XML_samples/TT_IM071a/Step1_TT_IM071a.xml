			SCENARIO
			Trader submits a Type A Frontier declaration for goods being imported from ROW to NI "At Risk" that attracts Definitive Anti-Dumping Duties (DADD).
			AI code 'NIIMP' entered at Item Level.
			Trader has claimed Subsidy by entering 'NIAID' also at Item level.
			Trader has applied Additional Procedure Code '1NN', which allows for relief of EU Customs Duties (A50 only).
			Subsidy accounts for the remaining Additional EU Customs Duties (A80) as a security (STA).
			B05 is calculated as 0.00 as there are no EU Customs Duties to pay.
			B00 is calculated and charged using the UK Tariff rate.
			Indicative duty is calculated and DMSTAX and DMSACC Trader Notifications are sent prior to the Dwell Timer.
			Goods: Mixtures of urea and ammonium nitrate in aqueous or ammoniacal solution.
			Category: H1 Declaration Category data set.
			Goods presented at the port of Belfast.
			Expected Notifications (4): DMSACC, DMSTAX(1), DMSTAX(2) and DMSCLE.
