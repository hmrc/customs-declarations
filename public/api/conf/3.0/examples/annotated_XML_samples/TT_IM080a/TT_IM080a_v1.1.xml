			SCENARIO
			
			A trader is able to make use of an Additional Procedure Code 1RV and Additional Information code RVAT1 to relieve VAT on a ROW-GB Full Customs Declaration journey.
			
			A trader submits a Type A declaration with Procedure Code 4000 to derive the H1 dataset.
			The trader declares the Additional Procedure Code 'C07' in DE 1/11 at item level to indicate low value consignments up to £135.
			The trader declares the Additional Procedure Code '1RV' in DE 1/11 and the Additional Information code 'RVAT1' in DE 2/2 at item level to indicate code to relieve VAT.
			The trader declares an Item Price in DE 4/14 at item level that does not exceed £135.
			CDS will calculate VAT due and then suppress the VAT charged as a relief treatment.
			The following Trader Notifications are displayed: DMSACC, DMSTAX (Indicative), DMSTAX (Final), DMSCLE.
