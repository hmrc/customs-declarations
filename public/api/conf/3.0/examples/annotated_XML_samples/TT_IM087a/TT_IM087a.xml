		<!--
			SCENARIO
			To show that CDS does not allow or mandate the submission of a status code - Exemption, where document code Y978 is entered on an import declaration.

			A trader submits a H1 standard frontier Type A declaration importing goods from RoW-GB, declaring: 
			• Procedure type: 40 00 in D.E. 1/10 indicating entry for free circulation and
			home use of goods.
			• Document code: Y978 in DE 2/3 covers EU Reg 2019/1793 Art 1.3 exemptions: (c) non-commercial consignments of food and feed sent to natural persons which are not intended to be placed on the market.
			• Commodity code 0802220000 importing shelled hazelnuts from the country Georgia (GE).
			• Deferred Payment is used with standing authority. 
			• Importer's DAN is being used.
			• Goods presented at Wallasea Island on arrival.
			
			Note that this declaration uses a frontier declaration at Wallasea Island, Baltic Wharf (NILP) for test purposes only: for business use a pre-lodged declaration must be submitted because Baltic Wharf is listed as an 'Other listed location'.

			CDS will accept and process the declaration:
			• CDS will not allow or mandate the submission of a status code in D.E. 2/3 - Exemption.
			• Customs Duty will be calculated using the UK Tariff.
			• No Excise or VAT will be calculated using the UK Tariff.
			• DMS will generate the trader notifications.
			• Import of goods liable to Customs Duty & VAT, with no previous procedure.
