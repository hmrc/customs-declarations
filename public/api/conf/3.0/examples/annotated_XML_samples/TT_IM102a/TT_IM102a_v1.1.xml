			SCENARIO
			ROW-GB Valuation Method 4 + APC '1FV'.
			Duties calculated using Item Price.

			An agent submits a Type A (H1) declaration importing goods from ROW to GB.

			The agent enters the following information on the declaration:
			- Goods: Horseradish.
			- Deferred Payment is used with standing authority. 
			- Importer's DAN is being used.
			- Goods presented at Wallasea Island on arrival.
			- Import of goods liable to Customs Duty & VAT, with no previous procedure.
			- Additional Procedure Code '1FV' in D.E 1/11
			- Additional Document Code '9WKS' with status code 'AC' in D.E 2/3
			- Item Price in D.E 4/14
			- Valuation Method '4' in D.E 4/16
			- Country of Origin in D.E 5/15
			- Net Mass in D.E 6/1
			- Combined Nomenclature in D.E 6/14
			- TARIC code in D.E 6/15.
			
			Custom Duty will be calculated using the UK Tariff and the declared Item Price, at a rate of 12%. Customs Duty will be reserved as a Security Deposit.

			The agent gets notifications including DMSTAX from DMS confirming the successful acceptance and clearance of the declaration.

			Note that this declaration uses a frontier declaration at Wallasea Island, Baltic Wharf (NILP) for test purposes only: for business use a pre-lodged declaration must be submitted because Baltic Wharf is listed as an 'Other listed location'.
