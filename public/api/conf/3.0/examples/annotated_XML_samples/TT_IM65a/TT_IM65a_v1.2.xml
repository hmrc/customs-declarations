		<!--
			SCENARIO
			Goods are imported from ROW to GB (Mexico MX to GB). Goods are declared with a preferential UK quota claimed. 
			The UK quota has a Critical status and results in a partial allocation with a security deposit being reserved.
			
			Type A Import of goods liable to Customs Duty, VAT and Excise Duty.
			Goods also subject to Quota
			Type A Standard Declaration with 1 goods item.
			Procedure code 40 00, with 000 (no additional procedure code)
			Standard declaration: H1 additional declaration type A – Release for Free Circulation.
			Importer EORI number: GB553202734852
			Self-representation used by the importer.
			Commodity Code: 2009419220 - Pineapple juice, not from concentrate
			Expected Notifications (6): DMSACC, DMSTAX(1), DMSTAX(2), DMSROG, DMSTAX(3) and DMSCLE

			N.B. There are currently no Quota Id's with a '5th' digit of '6' which are 'Critical' in Tariff, therefore, a Security Deposit will not be charged at present. 
			
			Note that this declaration uses a frontier declaration at Wallasea Island, Baltic Wharf (NILP) for test purposes only: for business use a pre-lodged declaration must be submitted because Baltic Wharf is listed as an 'Other listed location'.
