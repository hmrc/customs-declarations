		<!--SCENARIO
			Request Declaration Status via an API.

			A CSP submits a Type A Declaration which is Accepted and Cleared (e.g. TT_IM01a)
			The CSP then submits a Declaration Status Request using the Movement Reference Number (MRN).
			This is the unique Declaration ID generated by DMS on submission of the original Declaration.

			As the MRN matches that generated on submission of the original Declaration, the API Response message returned provides the current status of the Declaration within DMS.
			n.b. The Status request must be made within a 180 day period from the date the declaration was received by CDS.
