		<!--
			SCENARIO
			EU-NI-GB Indirect Movement - Duties Calculation and VAT Suppression
			Trader submits a Type A Frontier Imports declaration, moving goods from the EU (Ireland) to GB via NI.
			Customs Duty and Excise (if applicable) are charged as per the UK Tariff. 
			However, as VAT will be accounted for via the Trader's VAT return (thus away from CDS), it should be suppressed on the declaration.
			Expected Notifications (4): DMSACC, DMSTAX(1), DMSTAX(2) and DMSCLE   
			
			Note that this declaration uses a frontier declaration at Wallasea Island, Baltic Wharf (NILP) for test purposes only: for business use a pre-lodged declaration must be submitted because Baltic Wharf is listed as an 'Other listed location'.
