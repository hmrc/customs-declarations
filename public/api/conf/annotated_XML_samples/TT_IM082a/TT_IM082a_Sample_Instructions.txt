Sample Guidance 
***************

Data for this scenario will be generated by running a base payload, and then running multiple amendments to create the various version numbers. The declaration payload for TT_IM2a and amendment payloads for TT_IM02b and TT_IM02c are used in this sample. 

A CSP submits a query for an Import declaration they have submitted, using the MRN parameter.

All versions of the declaration that matches the input search parameter must be returned in a single response.

Declaration versions should be returned in reverse chronological order.
